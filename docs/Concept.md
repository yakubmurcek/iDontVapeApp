# Concept

**Goal:** make people quit vaping
**Design and feel:** high-tech bio twin machine in need of repair, interactive 3D sci-fi wireframe visualization of the user's lungs and cardiovascular system
# Business Model
*   need to catch attention and provide value in first 15 sec
*   no login, no mindless lore and clicking, no general onboarding
*   differentiate from all other, analyze competitors in vaping + smoking
*   market as made by a vape user who made this to quit himself, market like that reels on TikTok
*   paid subscription, lifetime + yearly (4 months free just now) + monthly
*   paywall displayed at the right time, as often as RevenueCat recommends and good situations
# Onboarding Flow
1. **Input vaping history** (Onboarding System Diagnostics, bio scanning...)
    1. How long have you vaped?
    2. What nicotine strength?
    3. How many puffs per day?
2. The app estimates current damage + calculates their starting "System Integrity Score" (e.g., 65%). This is their baseline.
    *   The Calibration Animation
        As they enter data, a generic wireframe torso on screen begins to fill with red "corruption" data points based on their answers.
# Main Screen
*   Based on the onboarding data, specific zones are glowing red (inflamed bronchi) or look jagged (reduced lung capacity)
*   A rotating holographic wireframe of the human lungs + heart (center 60% of the screen)
    *   **Lungs**
        *   inflammation, EVALI, scarring, asthma, bronchitis​
        *   Vaping torches your lungs with poison gas—causing killer swelling, permanent scars, brutal asthma attacks, and deadly pneumonia that leaves you gasping for air forever
    *   **Heart**
        *   inflammation​
        *   Your heart inflames and fails fast, pumping you straight to a heart attack or stroke
    *   **Blood vessels**
        *   impaired endothelial function, reduced nitric oxide, increased permeability​
        *   Arteries clog and burst open from toxic sludge, starving your body of blood and dooming you to clots and collapse

*       *   **LATER: Brain**
        *   nicotine effects on development, memory, seizures​
        *   Nicotine hijacks your brain, wrecking memory, sparking seizures, and trapping you in addiction hell for life—especially if you're young

*       *   **LATER: Mouth**
        *   gum disease, tooth loss​
        *   Gums bleed and teeth fall out in agonizing pain from the chemical burn

*       *   **LATER: Gut tortured**
        *   Nausea hits hard, vomiting your life away while poisons eat your insides.

*   LATER: The user can spin and zoom the model with touch gestures.

# User Progress
PULMONARY SYSTEM RECOVERY
30.4% RESTORED (number ticks up slowly based on medical recovery timelines)

*   Overlaid on the center of the chest is a prominent, glowing data ring.
*   **Next Milestone**: Cilia Regeneration complete in 2 days
*   User abstains from nicotine → their Bio-Twin repair itself in real-time
*   Transforming abstract health timelines into tangible, visually stunning progress
# Other
*   Time Since Last Exposure: 04D 12H 32M
*   Credits Saved: $45.50
*   Bottom Action Bar: A glowing "SOS / CRAVING" button and a "Logs" button.
*   This screen breaks down the "30% Recovered" into actionable health facts, framed as system upgrades.
*   Oxygen Uptake Status: \[||||||||----\] 70% Efficiency.
*   Carbon Monoxide Purge: \[COMPLETED\] - System Clear.
*   Nicotine Receptor Normalization: \[|||-------\] 30% Complete. (Estimated time to completion: 3 weeks).
Vaping is often seen as a "cleaner" vice than smoking, making it harder to visualize the damage.
# Design
*   Holographic, scifi BUT functional and clean (not too movie like)
*   The Wireframe (The Bio-Twin): The organs are not solid flesh; they are stylized minimal representing complex lattices of glowing energy conduits
    *   **Damaged Areas**: Glitching, fragmented, static-filled reddish-orange nodal points. They look unstable
    *   **Recovered Areas**: Smooth, flowing, bright cyan and neon green energy streams. They pulse rhythmically
*   Color Palette: Deep space charcoal backgrounds. Neon cyan with little green (health), electric blue (data), caution amber (warning/craving), and critical red (damage)
